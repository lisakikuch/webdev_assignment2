Project name: M達i m達i

Given that, I made a landing page for a lipstick brand called M達i m達i. This website aims to make it appealing and give a positive image about the company and its products to encourage purchase.
The main target of this website is women in their 20s to 40s who are looking for luxurious cosmetics.

Description: The website has a navigation bar, a hero section, company and product sections, a video section, and a footer with contact information and related links.

To make the photos visually appealing and match the theme of this website,
- Chose simple but luxurious photos of lipsticks and models.
- Chose monotonous colors, such as black, grey, and white, to make the images and video stand out.

To ensure the design consistency,
- Used Bootstrap to ensure that all contents except the nav bar and footer are aligned at the same level.
- Used only the picked three colors.
- Used the same typography.
- Used media queries to ensure all images and texts displayed properly according to the screen size.
  
Additionally, make sure to add the semantic tags correctly to each section.
